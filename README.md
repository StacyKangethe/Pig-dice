# Pig Dice
#### The objective of the Pig Dice Game is to score 100 points before your opponent does. The game is played with a single six-sided die. Continue rolling the die until you are happy with the number of points you have scored, and end your turn. If you roll a one, you lose all the points you accumulated during that turn, and you lose your turn.27/08/2018 {
